Issues:

	* Arrow keys cause scrolling when set up in line-mode configuration (overflow:scroll)
	* Clipboard support
	* Text selection
	* Need right-side cursor
	* When empty, make some sort of other cursor thingy.... or use some other cursor thingy alltogether :-/

Tasks:

 	* getValue, setValue
	
	* support non-character artifacts
	** Configurable: whether they can be edited with keyboard (callback for internal editing)

	* Editor framework

Nice-to-haves:

	* Insert/Overwrite
